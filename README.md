load_db: Load a database from a file. You will be prompted to enter the filename.
display: Display the contents of the database, the loaded DNA, and the STR counts.
load_dna: Load a DNA sequence from a file. You will be prompted to enter the filename.
process: Process the loaded DNA sequence and update the STR counts.
search: Search the database for a match with the processed DNA sequence.
creative: Display the highest number of pairs of nitrogenous bases (AT and GC) in each STR of the loaded database.
